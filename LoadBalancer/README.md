## Building Your Own Load Balancer

### Understanding Load Balancing

A load balancer serves several critical functions in a network infrastructure:

* Efficiently distributes client requests or network load across multiple servers.
* Ensures high availability and reliability by directing requests only to online servers.
* Provides scalability by enabling the addition or removal of servers based on demand.

## Types of Load Balancing

Load balancing strategies typically fall into two categories:

### Static Load Balancing:

Static load balancing does not consider the real-time state of backend servers. It simply distributes requests evenly or based on predefined rules. Common static algorithms include:

* Round-robin: Rotates requests evenly among backend servers.
* Weighted round-robin: Allows for different weights to balance server loads.
* IP hash: Utilizes client IP addresses to determine server assignments.

### Dynamic Load Balancing:

Dynamic load balancing adjusts server assignments based on real-time server conditions. Key dynamic algorithms include:

* Least connection: Routes requests to servers with the fewest open connections.
* Weighted least connection: Balances loads based on server capacity and current connections.
* Weighted response time: Directs requests to servers with the lowest average response time.
* Resource-based: Considers server resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) when distributing requests.

## Planning the Implementation

Before diving into coding, it's crucial to outline the system requirements and design:

* Develop a load balancer capable of managing traffic to multiple servers.
* Implement health checks to monitor server status.
* Handle server failures and recoveries gracefully.

### Tech Stack and Implementation Approach

For the load balancer, we'll use Java with Spring Web Flux for its asynchronous capabilities. Backend servers can be simple Python web servers. Here's an overview of the planned implementation:

1. **Controller Class**: Define endpoints for load balancing, adding servers, and removing servers.
2. **Data Structure**: Choose a suitable structure to store and retrieve backend servers efficiently. We'll use a circular linked list for its simplicity and effectiveness.
3. **Initialization**: Initialize server lists from a config file or allow servers to register dynamically.
4. **Health Checks**: Implement a background thread to periodically check server health and update the server list accordingly.
5. **Load Balancing Logic**: Use a round-robin algorithm to distribute requests among available servers.

## Code Implementation

The load balancer will periodically check the health of backend servers. If a server fails the health check, it's removed from the rotation until it becomes available again. Here's a simplified example of the health check implementation:

```java
private void startHealthCheck() {
    if (backgroundThread == null || !backgroundThread.isAlive()) {
        running = true;
        backgroundThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (running) {
                try {
                    for (int i = 0; i < config.getAddress().size(); i++) {
                        HealthCheckRunnable runnable = new HealthCheckRunnable(restTemplate, list, config, i);
                        new Thread(runnable).start();
                    }
                    Thread.sleep(10000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    running = false;
                }
            }
        });
        backgroundThread.start();
    }
}

public void run() {
    String response = null;
    try {
        response = template.getForObject(config.getAddress().get(t), String.class);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.error(e.getMessage());
    }

    if (response != null) {
        logger.info("Server is up " + config.getId().get(t));
        list.addBackServer(t);
    } else {
        logger.info("Server down " + config.getId().get(t));
        try {
            list.removeServer(config.getId().get(t));
        } catch (ServerNotFoundException e) {
            logger.error(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This approach ensures that only healthy servers receive traffic, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of the load balancer.

In the next phase, we can explore advanced load balancing techniques, such as sticky sessions and consistent hashing, to further optimize performance and resource utilization.
